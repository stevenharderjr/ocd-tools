# Ratioizer

### Keep sets of values and allow dynamic adjustments without changing proportions between them.

For example, my nominal cup of coffee comprises 20g sugar, 200ml coffee, and 150ml half & half.

### Problem 1
If I'm short on half & half, I need the ratio between the available amount (128 ml) and the nominal amount (150 ml).

* R = 128/150 **(~0.85)**

* **~170 ml Coffee**  (200\*R)

* **~17 g Sugar** (20\*R)

### Problem 2
If I want to fill a larger cup, I need the ratio between the capacity of the cup (440 ml) and the sum of the nominal values (370 ml).

R = 370/440 **(~1.19)**

* **~238 ml Coffee** (200*R)

* **~178 ml Half & Half** (150*R)

* **~24 g Sugar** (20*R)

The solutions are fairly straightforward, but they involve time, attention, and data entry each time a problem arises.
It's much more convenient to be able to adjust one nominal value and have the others update accordingly.
